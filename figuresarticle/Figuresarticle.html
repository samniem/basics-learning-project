                In this article we talk about a particularly amazing and interesting topic.
                This topic does not make much sense but it is very interesting nevertheless.
                With this in mind we randomly keep adding text here. The purpose of the text
                is to serve as interesting and truly fascinating filler content experience.
            </p>    
            <h2>The Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The experience is going to be so amazing that you cannot help but feel
                that your mind has been truly blown away for no particularly good reason.
                Once you finish reading this text you will feel entertained but you will
                also feel like you have wasted a part of your life for nothing.
            </p>
            <h2>The Promise</h2>
            <p>
                In this article we promise that there will be absolutely nothing of value
                as far as the text itself is concerned. However, concerning the text, it will
                serve as good filled content for practicing HTML markup. As a consequence this
                article promises a superior lifestyle experience you have not been able to imagine
                before hand.

            <h2>The Image</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="./magic.jpg" alt="magic.jpg"/>
                <figcaption><strong>Figure 2.</strong>&nbspThis is a magical magic picture for a random article.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>This part offers a fascinating description about an image that has not been decided yet.
            The image is so superior because of the HTML markup language that it could be displayed
            next to Mona Lisa. There is not much else to say about this amazing topic.
